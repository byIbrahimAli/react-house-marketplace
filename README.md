# Summary
Simple housing react app.

**Core React Concepts:**

- JSX: The App.js and index.js files use JSX to define the structure of the React components.
- Functional Components: The App.js defines a functional component named App.
- React Router: The App.js file uses react-router-dom for client-side routing (BrowserRouter, Routes, Route).
- React Hooks: Though not explicitly visible in the provided files, common React hooks (useState, useEffect) are likely used in other components/pages.
- Context API: Not visible in the provided files but might be used elsewhere in the project for state management.
- React Strict Mode: Used in index.js to highlight potential problems in an application.

**Additional Libraries and Tools:**

- React Toastify: For notifications (ToastContainer).
- Firebase: Integrated for backend services.
- React Leaflet: For interactive maps.
- Swiper: Likely used for carousels/sliders.
- UUID: For generating unique identifiers.
- Testing Libraries: @testing-library/react, @testing-library/jest-dom, @testing-library/user-event.

**Project Configuration:**

- Package Management: Dependencies are managed using package.json.
- Build and Start Scripts: Scripts for starting, building, testing, and ejecting the app using react-scripts.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
